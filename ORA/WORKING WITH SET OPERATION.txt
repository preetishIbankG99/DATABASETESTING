UNION::
=======
Combines the result of two select statements into one result set,and then eliminates any duplicate rows from that result set
+>select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10 union select empno,ename from emp where deptno=30 order by 1;
+>select empno,ename,job from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='sales') union 
select empno,ename,job from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='Accounting')order by 1;
+>select job from emp where deptno=20 union select job from emp where deptno=30;
UNION ALL::
===========
combines the result of  two select statements into one result set including the duplicates
+>select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10 union all select empno,ename from emp where deptno=30 order by 1;
+>select job from emp where deptno=20 union all select job from emp where deptno=30;
INTERSECT::
===========
Returns only those rows that are returned by each of two select statements
+>select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10 intersect
select empno,ename from emp where deptno=30 order by 1;
+>select job from emp where deptno=20 intersect
select job from emp where deptno=30;
MINUS::
========
Takes the result set  of one select statement,and removes those rows that are also returned by a second select statement
+>select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10 minus
select empno,ename from emp where deptno=30 order by 1;
+>select job from emp where deptno=20 minus
select job from emp where deptno=10;
+>select rownum,ename from emp where rownum<7 minus
select rownum,ename from emp where rownum<6;
