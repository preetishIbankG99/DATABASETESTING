PHP Multidimensional Arrays
===========================

An array can also contain another array as a value, which in turn can hold other arrays as well. In such a way we can create two- or three-dimensional arrays:

Example

<?php
// A two-dimensional array:
$cars = array
  (
  array("Volvo",100,96),
  array("BMW",60,59),
  array("Toyota",110,100)
  );
?>

PHP - Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.

In a multidimensional array, each element in the main array can also be an array. And each element in the sub-array can be an array, and so on.

Example

In this example we create a multidimensional array, with automatically assigned ID keys:

$families = array
  (
  "Griffin"=>array
  (
  "Peter",
  "Lois",
  "Megan"
  ),
  "Quagmire"=>array
  (
  "Glenn"
  ),
  "Brown"=>array
  (
  "Cleveland",
  "Loretta",
  "Junior"
  )
  );
The array above would look like this if written to the output:

Array
(
[Griffin] => Array
  (
  [0] => Peter
  [1] => Lois
  [2] => Megan
  )
[Quagmire] => Array
  (
  [0] => Glenn
  )
[Brown] => Array
  (
  [0] => Cleveland
  [1] => Loretta
  [2] => Junior
  )
)
Example 2

Lets try displaying a single value from the array above:

echo "Is " . $families['Griffin'][2] . 
" a part of the Griffin family?";
The code above will output:

Is Megan a part of the Griffin family?
