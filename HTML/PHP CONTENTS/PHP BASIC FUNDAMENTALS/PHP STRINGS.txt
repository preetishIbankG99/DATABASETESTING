String Variables in PHP
========================
String variables are used for values that contain characters.

After we have created a string variable we can manipulate it. A string can be used directly in a function or it can be stored in a variable.

In the example below, we create a string variable called txt, then we assign the text "Hello world!" to it. Then we write the value of the txt variable to the output:

Example

<?php
$txt="Hello world!";
echo $txt;
?>

The PHP Concatenation Operator
==============================
There is only one string operator in PHP.

The concatenation operator (.)  is used to join two string values together.

The example below shows how to concatenate two string variables together:

Example

<?php
$txt1="Hello world!";
$txt2="What a nice day!";
echo $txt1 . " " . $txt2;
?>

The PHP strlen() function
=========================
Sometimes it is useful to know the length of a string value.

The strlen() function returns the length of a string, in characters.

The example below returns the length of the string "Hello world!":
EXAMPLE
========
<?php
echo strlen("Hello world!");
?>

The PHP strpos() function
=========================
The strpos() function is used to search for a character or a specific text within a string.

If a match is found, it will return the character position of the first match. If no match is found, it will return FALSE.

The example below searches for the text "world" in the string "Hello world!":

Example
-------

<?php
echo strpos("Hello world!","world");
?>
