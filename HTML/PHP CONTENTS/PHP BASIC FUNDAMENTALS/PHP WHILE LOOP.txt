PHP Looping - While Loops
=========================
PHP Loops
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row. Instead of adding several almost equal lines in a script we can use loops to perform a task like this.

In PHP, we have the following looping statements:

while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true
for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
The while Loop
The while loop executes a block of code while a condition is true.

Syntax

while (condition)
  {
  code to be executed;
  }
Example

The example below first sets a variable i to 1 ($i=1;).

Then, the while loop will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to 5. i will increase by 1 each time the loop runs:

<html>
<body>

<?php
$i=1;
while($i<=5)
  {
  echo "The number is " . $i . "<br>";
  $i++;
  }
?>

</body>
</html>
Output:

The number is 1
The number is 2
The number is 3
The number is 4
The number is 5

The do...while Statement
The do...while statement will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the condition is true.

Syntax

do
  {
  code to be executed;
  }
while (condition);
Example
========

The example below first sets a variable i to 1 ($i=1;).

Then, it starts the do...while loop. The loop will increment the variable i with 1, and then write some output. Then the condition is checked (is i less than, or equal to 5), and the loop will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to 5:

<html>
<body>

<?php
$i=1;
do
  {
  $i++;
  echo "The number is " . $i . "<br>";
  }
while ($i<=5);
?>

</body>
</html>
Output:

The number is 2
The number is 3
The number is 4
The number is 5
The number is 6
